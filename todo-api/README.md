## todo-api

Back end for a todo list app, using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

This code was developed while working through [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) on Udemy.

It differs from the original code provided with the course in many ways:

- Uses `async`/`await` syntax throughout
- Uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for testing instead of Mocha
- Contains some additional unit tests and test fixtures
- Many parts of the code and the tests have been refactored
- Lots of differences in the way files and their contents are organized
- Uses the [Prettier](https://prettier.io) code formatter
